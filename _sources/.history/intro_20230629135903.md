# Welcome to BSCS archive Site!

Welcome! One of my several (and favorite) stops at WGU was the BSCS team. During my time there, we built a collection of supplementary resources. As most of these resoruces were stored in Google, they became broken when WGU moved from Google to MS services. To preserve student access to these resources, I built this little. Please let me know if anything needs to be added.

## Start Here

First, understand the project's requirements. What they are -and what they aren't. Watch the following video:

Task 3, the Report, *mostly* rewrites the Proposal, task 2. Hence, task 2 represents 80-90% of the capstone work. For a more in-depth understanding of this crucial task, view the section-by-section [videos explaining task 2](resources:task2) and the [video on writing task 3](resources:task3).
