C952 Computer Architecture 

Welcome to C952, Computer Architecture! This course is an interactive survey of Computer Architecture based on Patterson and Hennessy's widely used text Computer Organization and Design (referred to as COD in my books). The textbook has a lot of great and exciting information. But while the textbook is both deep and broad, the assessment is just broad. In general, students have found the exam more accessible than the textbook (take a look at the course chatter). The objective assessment assesses an introductory depth of the content. As such, students should focus on understanding the significant concepts in context with a focus on optimization.

These problems are code generated. So I can easily make more on request.
