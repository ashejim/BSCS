# Creating a Github VC Page

At the heart of GitHub is the open-source version control system (VCS) -Git. For the non-software folks, Git is for managing collaborative projects. It maintintains consitentcy while developers simulatenously work on the same project -but for your CV there will probably only be one "developer" -you. So some of the more complictaed things about Git can be skipped over, e.g., push, pull, merge, etc. You will only need to sync your local with your online files (in the GitHub repo) and then publish the repo files to GitHub pages.

This section covers getting the basics to get started:

1. A Github.com account
2. An HTML editor

Everything can be done through terminal, but we'll keep things simple and stick with the GitHub online GUI. 

## Create a GitHub

If you already have a GitHub repository you can skip to the next section, [Create entry file](GitHub_CV:entry_files). More details here: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).
2. Create a new repositroy: $+$.
3. Give it a name.
4. Optional: set to **Public**, add a **README** file, and **Choose a license**.
5. Click **Create Repository**

Setting the repos' name to your GitHub *username* creates a special repository. It's a good idea. You'll be able to use the same name and repo for both an online CV and a GitHub profile (see: [How to Create a GitHub Portfolio(https://github.com/katiehuangx/How-to-Create-a-GitHub-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md)).
